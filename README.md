<h1>HR-ANALYTICS </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates the sales transactions occurring at a supermarket. This dataset is a rich source of information, comprising 1,000 individual entries, each representing a unique transaction. These entries are further divided into 17 distinct columns, each column representing a specific attribute related to the sales transactions. The attributes could range from the type of product sold, the quantity, the time of purchase, to the demographics of the customer, among others. This structured and detailed organization of data provides an invaluable opportunity to delve deep into the various aspects of supermarket sales. It allows for a thorough analysis and understanding of sales patterns, customer behavior, popular products, peak shopping times, and so much more. The insights derived from this dataset could be instrumental in driving strategic business decisions, optimizing operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction in the supermarket industry.
